# Index

What I like the most about using [Obsidian][obs] is its powerful search capability. You probably won't need this indexing page, since the search bar can actually find things for you, down to specific keywords, really quickly. However, it would be nice to have a page where I can list all the tags used, because, you know, you can't find something you don't know about. By showing what I have, you'll probably develop an interest in something. This isn’t like the Vatican Library, where you have to know what you're looking for first without knowing what they have! At least, that’s what I’ve heard from our modern-day source of information, Google, though I’m not sure how accurate that is.

Before we spiral down a conspiracy theory rabbit hole—which I’m not really interested in (this sounds like something a closeted conspiracy believer would say)—here, peruse this list of tags you can randomly check out:

#poetry #poetry/EN #poetry/TL

Here's another interesting feature of this website, which is mind-blowing to me at least: you can browse 'Connected Pages,' which, in theory, should resemble your neurons linking to each other. How cool is that!
