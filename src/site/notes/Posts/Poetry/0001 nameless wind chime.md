# nameless wind chime
___

___

a creaking, then a thud, then nothing
after gusts of wind siege through the silence
of his room, it was him, all along, a nameless
wind chime suspended by the lace of his work I.D.
on the same nail where he thought he would
hang the dreamcatcher bought last week

it’s one of those purchases
at one point his plan was a copy of Either/Or
but he ended up with an empty notebook
because sometimes angst is nauseating
and it’s nice to try, to end your thoughts
with your own words, if at all, possible

after a month or so, maybe because he’s moving
he completely forgot about the notebook
his first entry after a week of thinking then
was shit. and that sounds about right, shit.
short and simple, if he learned anything somehow
a complete thought, so they say— shit.

in this new apartment, fourth one this year
wanting to make things right, as if a wind chime would do it
and a span of curtain too, would be nice to hear the wind coming in
a Mandala clothe would wave and dance to it, he thought
unlike those previous places he’s been through
this will be the last, and that, no one belongs anywhere— anyway

it’s one of those purchases
so he ended up with a dreamcatcher— instead of a chime
in a dry afternoon, and an equally hot wind if there’s one
outside is a dizzying maze of colorful market umbrellas
being in the middle of an overwhelmingly loud noise of commerce
you do what you can, and it’s better to be out of there, fast

a dreamcatcher! at least do something, or it defeats the purpose of going out
which he rarely does, and it has this Mandala-esque winding threads
in a circular wooden frame, and those feathers in shades of black
not bad at all, and now he has a problem, this protruding nail
on a blank wall up the window, begs more of a purpose it seems
more than a dreamcatcher— he doesn’t have any dreams to catch anymore

after a week or so, maybe because he just moved
he completely forgot about the dreamcatcher
but tonight’s silence reminded him
that a wind chime would make a tinkling out of it
and a span of curtain would dance along the sound
looking back, maybe Either/Or was not that big of a deal
and maybe shit. was a better way to end his thoughts
