# 0001_Let's Do This!

I still have things to do! I really thought I could focus on the content at this point, but I guess I wanted to know how this website would perform from day one and probably have a historical account to look back on. This means that I need to work on analytics. When I looked into how I could enable web analytics, it showed me this:

Now, I don't have any idea what any of this means, for now. I'm staying positive brother. I'm learning along the way and the best part really is I'm enjoying this.

It feels like a necessity to learn all this not because I'm thinking of earning more than what I am earning right now, if any. Really, this is a personal passion project and I am going to amor fati my way until the end I guess, whatever that is. There's no way but to **not try**, like the great Bukowski, he never tried anything.
