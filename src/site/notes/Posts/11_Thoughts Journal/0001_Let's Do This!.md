I still have things to do! I really thought I could focus on the content at this point, but I guess I wanted to know how this website would perform from day one and probably have a historical account to look back on. This means that I need to work on analytics. When I looked into how I could enable web analytics, it showed me this:

I don't have any idea what any of this means for now, but I’m staying positive, brother. I'm learning along the way, and the best part is that I’m really enjoying this.

It feels like a necessity to learn all this, not because I'm thinking of earning more than I am right now, if anything at all. Really, this is a personal passion project, and I am going to embrace *amor fati* until the end, whatever that may be. There's no way but to **not try**[^1], like the great Bukowski—he never tried anything.

You'd think that if I just stayed focused on configuring the web analytics, I’d be done way before actually writing this update post, and you are—not wrong. But I think I won’t have enough time. As I mentioned, I have no idea what any of that means. I've been using Debian for years now, and initially tried to make this work with Quartz instead of Vercel, but I can't seem to make Quartz work on my system.

I'm not ready to switch to Windows just because of this because, well, this really is part of the fun.

I'd like to "binge write" about how I deep-dived into Existential Psychotherapy with Yalom's book, just because it perfectly coincides with the novel I wrote last year. But at the same time, I know it will take time and is probably better suited for the #fourpoints page.

Now, that's a really weird flex, but what I am getting at is that I just want to create a virtual room where I can dislodge what I have in mind. If this means learning something new, I'll learn all of it.

For now, I'll look for ways to implement web analytics and work on it this coming weekend.
