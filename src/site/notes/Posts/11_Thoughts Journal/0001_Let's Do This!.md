# 0001_Let's Do This!

I still have things to do! I really thought I could focus on the content at this point, but I guess I wanted to know how this website would perform from day one and probably have a historical account to look back on. This means that I need to work on analytics. When I looked into how I could enable web analytics, it showed me this:

I don't have any idea what any of this means for now, but I’m staying positive, brother. I'm learning along the way, and the best part is that I’m really enjoying this.

It feels like a necessity to learn all this, not because I'm thinking of earning more than I am right now, if anything at all. Really, this is a personal passion project, and I am going to embrace _amor fati_ until the end, whatever that may be. There's no way but to not try, like the great Bukowski—he never tried anything.
