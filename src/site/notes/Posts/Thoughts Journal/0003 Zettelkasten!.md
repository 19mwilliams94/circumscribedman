Yep, I got off on the wrong foot. It's not too bad, and I'm not being overly positive about it, but this should improve everything. I may have to restructure things to accommodate how I want to lay out learning and make new connections from the ideas I already have.

In 30 minutes, I need to go out to play badminton.

I will leave this here for now, and next week, this will be better, I think, for me.
