# The solution

Imagine your computer as a physical storage space. We can’t put everything on the floor, so we buy some shelves.

If we had a limitless number of shelves, we wouldn’t know which one to look on when we wanted to find something. So we get **ten shelves.**

We decide to **dedicate each shelf to an area of our life.**

The first will contain everything to do with our `life administration`. The second is for our `home business`, and the third covers our `music` hobby.

(Notice that we don’t try to _use_ all ten shelves. There’s room to grow.)p
