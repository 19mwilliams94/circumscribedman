# Re-Structuring Day 1

I'm sold on using the [[20 Posts/11_Thoughts Journal/0003 Zettelkasten!\|0003 Zettelkasten!]] method, especially after stumbling upon this website: [Zettelkasten](https://zettelkasten.de/overview/). Now, I'm mainly going to use [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/) for this instead of [The Archive](https://zettelkasten.de/the-archive/) because, well, [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/)  is free and follows the same principles from what I've read so far.


And they said it themselves ([Zettelkasten](https://zettelkasten.de/overview/)):

Now, as this is my first day of learning, the next logical step after reading the overview is to dive into the introduction. However, what intrigues me the most is their advice against using categories, which, obviously, is what I have right now.

We all grew up thinking in terms of categories instead of links, right? From school subjects to organizational structures, even stereotyping relies on categories we have in mind. I am about to read their article titled “[Why Categories for Your Note Archive are a Bad Idea](https://zettelkasten.de/posts/no-categories/) ,” but I think I already have an idea: as we grow up, we realize that categories are just the "face" of what we have in mind, while the core working element behind this is the covert linking between ideas.

I have to go now. I need to work! I'll give another update by tomorrow.

Enjoy!
