# (REF) Why Categories for Your Note Archive are a Bad Idea
**Created: 202406141335**

1. No path is paved, everything is possible.
2. Creating categories is a top-down process. You start with the structure and then file the material away. Notes will have to fit the structure. If they don’t, there’ll have to be a compromise.
3. Our brain doesn’t work with categories, at least not initially. It may invent categories to become more efficient, but we don’t start our lives on pre-existing categories.
4. When knowledge increases, the web of things we know grows organically.
5. Man-made structures, on the other hand, are not growing. They are built.
6. Topic clusters emerge by themselves, especially surrounding keywords or tags. The resulting archive fits the way you think because it grew according to your interests. Also, things are labeled in a way especially meaningful to _you_, not anybody else. This is all about _personal information management_, so personalization is a must, and increasing idiosyncrasy will likely make things better.
7. Starting is always better than not doing a thing.
8. When you ditch categories completely, you can’t even do anything wrong during set-up, because you don’t set-up anything at all!
9. Trust your creativity in finding supportive rules with time.
