# About

Hello there, that’s me in the photo, swimming away from the plunge pool. I swam too carelessly and realized that the undercurrent was way too strong. What the hell am I doing in the first place?

Exactly, this could very well be about those times when I pause my intrusive train of thought and repent. It's really about those quiet moments I intentionally engage in daily. It’s kind of my personal prayer before I start my day and before the day ends. It’s a habit now to just sit quietly, think about the things I have to do, and end the day with a reflection.

I’ve been doing this for years! Of course, not consistently—I’m a normal person. I have an [Obsidian Vault][obv] I call my thought journal that helps me a lot when I need to just step out of the moment and reflect.

Like I said, it’s about those quiet times that strike you off-guard, making you realize the "moment" just happened after it passes. I could certainly keep this to myself, but I also want to learn in public. Especially after reading [Show Your Work][syw], which really inspired me to not shy away from what I am doing. Show it to the world, get the attention of one or two people who might have misclicked while trying to reach their favorite porn site, and improve collectively with those who share my interests (not the porn site people).

I can already see it: no one’s going to notice this site, and no, that’s not my goal. I could easily create a social media page, share everything I have in mind, and probably gain about 2 followers in three days (including a few misclicks). But then, I think that people who enjoy silence do not really participate in that type of barbaric digital jungle.

I have social media accounts, but I only use them to check the window, see how the digital world looks, judge people, and close it again for a day or two.

If you want to reach out to me for whatever reason, here’s my email: circumscribed_man@proton.me. 

Let’s see what we can do together!
