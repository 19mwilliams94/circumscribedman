# THIS IS A TEST

I'm starting to hate this introduction now. You see, I've been thinking about this for days! To be fair, I'm also mulling over how I want this cyber corner to look, so that's an excuse, like I always do when trying to write something. "War of Art" comes to mind, and before I completely derail from what this is supposed to be, welcome!

Now, I hate this intro not because I don't know what this website is all about, but because I have so many things I want to say without resorting to bullshit phrases like "the meaning of life" or "who am I?" And all those academic word salad metaphorical substrates. *wink*

For now, see what I have so far below. If you want to know more about why I bother, check the [[06_About\|06_About]] section, of course. And well, that section lacks, and always will, so if you care to know why I call this place [Circumscribed Man][circ_man], the [[02_Four Points\|02_Four Points]] section will roughly explain why. [[03_Medium\|03_Medium]] will tell you what I consume. Initially, I thought of purely sharing my reading list and progress, but to be honest, nowadays, who the hell reads?

Work!

Am I right?

Now, I'll still try to list the books I read and showcase how cultured I am, but then, I'm thinking of sharing impactful media (at least to me). As my friend [McLuhan][mcluhan] once said, "[The medium is the message][misdam]"â€”whatever that means.

So, the last thing really is that I'm a frustrated writer. So frustrated that I spent time creating this trash of a website oozing with a pretentious minimalist approach and self-deprecation. You can see my work in the [[04_Written\|04_Written]] section.

Enjoy!
